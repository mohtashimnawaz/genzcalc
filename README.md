A modern calculator for Gen Z number formats (e.g., `2K + 3K`, `1.5M - 500K`).

## How to Use

	- Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Enter your calculation:**
	- Type an expression using Gen Z terms (e.g., `2K + 3K`, `1.5M - 500K`, `1B / 2`).
	- Supported units:
	  - `K` = thousand
	  - `M` = million
	  - `B` = billion

3. **Get your result:**
	- Click the **Calculate** button.
	- The result will be shown instantly below the input.

## Example Expressions
- `2K + 3K` → `5,000`
- `1.5M - 500K` → `1,000,000`
- `1B / 2` → `500,000,000`
